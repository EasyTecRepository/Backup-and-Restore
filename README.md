# Scripts
This repository is about backup/restore scripts for an Unraid system. (Script in German)
These backup/restore scripts have been partially tested by me personally. 
However, I assume no liability if these scripts cause any kind of damage. 
Any person can check these scripts at any time! Before using one of the scripts please fill in variables!
ATTENTION! ALL MY SCRIPTS ARE CURRENTLY IN BETA VERSION!!! THERE MAY BE ERRORS OR BUGS!!!

This branch is for developer.
Here are all the problems that should be fixed in the scripts of this branch:

With my scripts in this repository you can make a backup/Restore from an Unraid server. This backup is written to a proxmox server. 
In this scripts is to be noted:
