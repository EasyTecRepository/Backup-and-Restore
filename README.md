# Scripts
This repository is about backup/restore scripts for a Unraid system. (Script available in English and German).
These backup/restore scripts have been tested by me personally. 
However, I do not assume any liability if these scripts cause any damage. 
Any person can check these scripts at any time! Before using any of the scripts, please fill in variables!
ATTENTION! ALL MY SCRIPTS ARE CURRENTLY IN BETA VERSION!!! THERE MAY BE ERRORS OR BUGS!!!

With my scripts in this repository you can make a backup/restore from a unraid server. This backup will be written to a proxmox server. 
In this script you have to note:
- Adjust variables!
- Instructions can be found on my blog (https://easytec.tech/index.php/2022/04/08/backupskript-fuer-unraid-auf-proxmox/) [These posts will soon be available in English as well.]
- Read the README.md and the LICENCE.md carefully if you want to use or reuse the script. (more info can be found on my blog)


Important information about the scripts:
My two scripts are available in English and in German.
In both languages there is a version with or without cache folder. By this I mean, if you use a cache on your Unraid system, you need the script for "with cache".
But if you don't use a cache, you have to use the normal script.
